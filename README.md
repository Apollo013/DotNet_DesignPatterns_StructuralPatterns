### Adapter Pattern
Works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by combining the functionality of both.

---

### Decorator Pattern
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without changing its structure.
It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality by wraping the original class and new behaviors/operations inside another object at run-time.

---

### Composite Pattern
The Composite pattern deals with putting individual objects together to form a whole. In mathematics the relationship between the objects and the composite object they build can be described by a part-whole hierarchy. The ingredient objects are the parts and the composite is the whole.

---

### Facade Pattern
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Fa√ßade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

---

### Flyweight Pattern
Flyweight design pattern is used when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class. Since every object consumes memory space that can be crucial for low memory devices, such as mobile devices or embedded systems, flyweight design pattern can be applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing objects.
