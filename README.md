### Adapter Pattern
Works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by combining the functionality of both.

---

### Decorator Pattern
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without changing its structure.
It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality by wraping the original class and new behaviors/operations inside another object at run-time.

---

### Facade Pattern
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Fa√ßade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
